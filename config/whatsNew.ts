// ── HOW TO ANNOUNCE SOMETHING NEW ────────────────────────────────────────
// 1. Add an object to the TOP of WHATS_NEW with a fresh, unique `id`.
// 2. Set `show: true`. Newest first — the modal renders them in array order.
// 3. Shipping a new id makes the bulletin reappear for everyone, even mid-
//    session (the id isn't in their "seen" set yet). Retire an item with
//    `show: false` — it won't retrigger. All items off → nothing renders.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
