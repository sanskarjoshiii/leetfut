// dump of ~250 countries, so finding your national team means scrolling past 200
// that aren't in the tournament.

// Codes are OUR flag keys, not ISO: England and Scotland are "eng"/"sct" (see
// UK_NATIONS in countries.ts), which is exactly the kind of thing a hand-written
// list gets wrong — so a test asserts every code below resolves to a real country
// AND a real flag asset.
//
// Includes the three hosts (Canada, Mexico, USA) and the two inter-confederation
// play-off winners (Iraq, DR Congo).
